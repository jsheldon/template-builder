template-builder
================

The TemplateBuilder is a simple console app that asks a couple of questions and generates ready to go projects for you.  

The basic flow would be something like this:

1. Create a solution the way you want it. (Basic Projects, Common Code, etc.)
2. Put that in a folder somewhere ( I have it in the 'Templates' folder)
3. Modify the program.cs and add the template to the List of Templates available.
4. Recompile the app.

Could this be improved?  Sure, there are ton of things that could be done to improve this..
- Smarter Templates..
- New Templates not requiring a recompile
- More things to be able to replace
- A better interface

For now though, it generates exactly what I need in like 5 seconds.
